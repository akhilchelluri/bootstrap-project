                   <p>Oxford Schools have been established with the vision of giving stress-free quality education. The schools have its beginning in Nandyal where the first campus was started in 1993 with 190 students in rented premises. To achieve a bigger vision, we started investing our efforts, time, energy and money into building spacious, green and own campuses spread across over 100s of acres.

                    From a humble start, we have grown continuously over the years, from Nandyal to Kurnool, Tirupathi, Anantapur, Hyderabad, Mahabubnagar, Proddatur, Chittor, Kadapa, Madanapalle, Rajahmundry, Srikakulam, Guntur, and Vikarabad. Right now our schools have 32 branches spread across ten districts in both the Telugu states. Over 52000 students have passed out from our schools since inception. Right now, the student strength in our campuses is 26500. Over 2000 trained faculty ensures that there a healthy and desired teacher-pupil ratio.</p><br>

            <p>Our educational institutions, since inception, have been a pioneer in giving stress-free quality education. Every student is given adequate attention and care in our spacious and green campuses. The top results achieved by our students in SSC exams every year bears testimony to this fact. Our first breakthrough was in the 2006 SSC results, wherein our students' secured State top ranks and since then the success saga continued every year. Our students scored top ten ranks continuously for several years. Our students continued to outperform others even after the introduction of the grading system.

                Because of the strong foundation laid in our classrooms, our students have been successfully cracking various competitive exams like EAMCET, IIT-JEE, NEET etc. Not just in academics, our students excel in games, sports and fine arts on the national and international level competitions.

    <h2 class="text-danger text-center fw-bold">Approach</h2>
    <p class="text-dark">Our approach to imparting education recognises the importance of the principle that each child is unique when it comes to learning capacities and needs. That's why we take utmost care in giving individualised attention and care to each child. Our teachers are continuously trained every year through summer workshops not only on the latest pedagogical methods but also on how to care for each child. We also believe that healthy and happy learning happens in stress-free environments. This we try to ensure through our spacious and green campuses which provide just the right kind of environment that nurtures the young minds where the adequate focus is also given to sports, games, arts and crafts learning, yoga, meditation etc.</p>
