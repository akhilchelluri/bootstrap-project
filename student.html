                <p>The adoption programme is the most prestigious programme which we implement within our schools. As the name signifies every teacher ‘adopts’ around 15-20 students and assumes complete responsibility in taking care of students in academic and behavioural matters. These adoption gurus regularly make calls on a fortnightly basis to parents to receive feedback.<br>

                    In the area of academics, individually tailored learning plans are prepared and implemented by the guru in coordination with the subject teacher and the parent. The progress is tracked daily and communicated to the parent. The guru also identifies the unique specific talents be it in sports, spelling bee, dance, painting etc. in a child. The guru in coordination with the parent also constructively counsels the student on any behavioural issues that the child may be facing. Thus the trio of guru, parent and subject teacher act as a supportive structure to the student.</p>

                <p class="text-light">The teachers in the primary classes are specially trained to be sensitive to the individual needs of the young minds from nursery to 2nd class. Teachers take extra care, and that is why they are aptly called ‘ Mother teachers’.<br>

                    Complete monitoring of the child is done at all times, and special care is given to children who need special assistance. We do not believe in physical punishments. Hence, regular counselling is given to the child regarding behavioural issues, and each parent is communicated with all the happenings at school.</p>

                <p class="text-light">Various approaches and strategies are used by teachers in our schools so that learning is not just confined to the one way ‘ teacher teaching- student listening’ approach. These include using real-life examples so that the concepts are clearly understood, practical approach to learning, using ICT tools in the delivery of teaching, conducting field trips related to subject learning, encouraging students to participate in science fairs and other competitions like Olympiads, intergroup competitions within the class and also across the campuses, group discussions and debates on issues etc. All these help the students in embracing a learning approach which is innovative, voluntary and fun.</p>

                <p class="text-light">Interactive classes are conducted on the campuses, unlike other schools. A healthy learning environment is cultivated right from day one in which the children are not afraid or feel inconvenienced at speaking up in the classrooms out of hesitation or fear of ridicule. This approach helps in clearing any doubts that the child may be having then and there itself apart from developing self-confidence and self-esteem in them.</p>

     <div >
        <h2 class="text-danger text-center fw-bold">Sports</h2>
        <p class="text-center text-dark">We strongly believe that student life within the campus should not be confined to just the classrooms. Sports<br> and Games bring many physical benefits to the child. Apart from that, they also help in developing the qualities<br> of team spirit, leadership, respect for authority, mental alertness and boosts self-confidence.<br><br>

                    Our spacious campuses and sports infrastructure within it provide ample opportunities for students to excel<br> in various sports. The school carefully nurtures any unique talents that the child has, and they are encouraged to<br> play in zonal/district/state and national level sports competitions. Our schools have a good track record of<br> winning several district/ state and national level sports competitions over the years.</p>

        <p class="text-light text-center">Yoga and meditation have been closely correlated with the physical, mental and spiritual development of an individual. That is why we have included both these in<br> our daily campus routines. Every day in the morning, there is a short 10-minute meditation session done by all the children and staff in the classroom.<br><br>

            Yoga classes are conducted twice per week for day scholars and daily in the morning for residential students. Apart from this, we also do summer yoga camps<br> every year at the Bachupally campus.</p><br><br>

       <p class="text-light text-center">The benefits of extracurricular activities are many. Engaging in sports, drama, painting, music, singing, dancing, debates etc. apart from providing a productive<br> break from study, they also help students to explore their interests and help develop broader mental perspective, improve self-esteem, improve social skills and<br> networks, teach life skills outside the classroom. They also look good on your admission applications to universities and resumes.

                <p class="text-dark">It's often the case that as we grow up what jobs /careers we are in and what we are good at are not the same, which leads to frustration and disenchantment. We believe that choosing a career path should be determined by one's aptitude and interests rather than what careers are ticking in the industry. Those who are fortunate in aligning their interests and vocations have a deep sense of fulfilment and satisfaction in life. That's why every year we conduct career counselling workshops to the outgoing 10th class students in tie-up with an NGO called Nirmaan Organisation. Wherein the aptitudes and interests of students are explored and assessed, and we suggest various career paths that are aligned.
