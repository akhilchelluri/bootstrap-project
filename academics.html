                <p class="text-light">THE ( Telugu, Hindi, English) programme is designed to enhance the reading levels of the students in all the three languages. As a first step, the current level of reading skills of each student is evaluated by the subject experts. Depending on this assessment every day the particular student is made to read a particular selected paragraphs from the textbook in front of the parents at home and also explain the meaning of it to the parent and communicate the feedback to the subject teacher on a day to day basis. This activity is done continuously until there is a perceptible change in the reading levels of the students.<br><br>

                    Thus the parents are also made stakeholders in this programme and are expected to play an active role. The response from results in terms of improvements in reading levels of students across the three languages has been great.</p>

Various activities are planned in these clubs which seek to enhance both the verbal and non-verbal communication skills and remove stage fear. Team spirit and leadership qualities are also inculcated among the students in these clubs.<br><br>

                    Various activities in these clubs include Picture talks, Sentence building races, Model conversations, role plays, seminars, speeches, discussions, debates, dramas, etc. These clubs are organised by English teachers who regularly evaluate students communication skills and presentation, give feedback and help students in overcoming the obstacles of effective communication.</p>

                <p>The pivot in education is the teacher … if the teacher improves, the education system will improve’. We strongly believe in this. That's why every year we conduct mandatory summer training workshops for all the teachers on our campuses.<br><br>

                    These workshops are done by outside educational experts who are well versed in the latest developments in the teaching methods and methodologies. These workshops also provide the opportunity for the faculty to stay up to date on the latest happenings in their subjects. Our dedicated, knowledgeable and well-trained faculty is indeed the strongest pillar of our institutions.
